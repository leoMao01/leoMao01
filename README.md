Hello ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about user-centered design and web development, I spent three years perfecting my skills as a designer to finally move into development.

I am proud to have acquired a versatility which today allows me to understand and collaborate with design teams on a daily basis.

My goal is to merge my designer skills with my developer skills to go further in design and to have a positive impact on digital products.
